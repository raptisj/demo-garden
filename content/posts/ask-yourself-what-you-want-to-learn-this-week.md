What did I learn last week?
* I read about pros and cons of being a generalist from different points of view

This week, I'm pulled towards writing about identity, like how talk of vaccines has entered the realm of identity topics, right there with religion and politics. I read Mike Solana's and Astral Codex Ten's libertarian views. They presented some graphs & data, but I don't want to fact check them.

I read about Einstein's views. I know about Viktor Frankl's views. They share a common thread of seeking joy. Einstein was interested in facts, not opinions, which is what science is, but even then you get rigid and may not want to hear other people out with good ideas e.g, quantum.

Everyone is inundated with vaccine information, and we're hearing about these breakthrough cases, which is confusing, for everyone. We all just want to feel good emotionally. Emotional and mental wellbeing is so important, too.

Today, Harry & I are going on a hike and then to the antique market. Being outdoors in nature is replenishing. It helps get you out of thinking mind.

I could use some events during the week where I have stimulating conversations, like with interintellect, or with ness. I.I salons are the closest thing to gatherings in real life because there are people there who I don't know. What thoughts do I have with new people?
