Twitter can be a great learning resource but it should be used sparingly and curated. Why? Because Twitter can easily become entertainment and a distraction. I work in short, 1 week focus sprints. At the beginning of each week, I ask myself:
* What do I want to focus on this week?

Last week, it was writing three things:
* my newsletter post
* getting my personal website up
* reading Sean Carroll's book _Something Deeply Hidden_

Keep it simple. There will be days when you're mood is not great and your motivation will be low. Just remember, you only have to do any one of your focus areas for 10 minutes. Even if you feel crappy, just set a 10 minute timer. When the timer goes off, you'll find that you'll either want to continue working or you'll want to stop. Either one is fine. Never force it.

Okay, back to Twitter. You'll find that in-between working on your focus areas, you'll want to check Twitter. Also, when you're stuck on a focus area, you'll want to check Twitter. Why? Because your friends are on it and they usually share inspirational things. This can be good and motivating. But, sometimes, when you go on Twitter you'll see some weird Tweets that take your mind to space. You can't control this. You can't control the Twitter feed. You can't control what people Tweet. So, to reduce the chance that your mind will go to space, you need to curate Twitter.

At the start of the week, when you choose your focus areas, [ask yourself what you want to learn this week]("/ask yourself what you want to learn this week.md"). Then, figure out who on Twitter can help you learn these things.

This may seem strange, but I want to learn more about cars. I've been shopping for a car and I feel stuck.
