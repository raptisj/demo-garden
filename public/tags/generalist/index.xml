      <description>Generalists vs. Specialists School teaches us to think like specialists. You are probably already familiar with the specialist mental model for problem solving:
  make a list of all anticipated tasks
  complete the first task
  complete the second task
  continue to complete all tasks until there are none left
  The specialist approach makes it seem as if problem solving is linear, as if completing one task will unlock another task, and just like a game, you keep leveling up until youâ€™ve won.</description>
