      <description>Ernest Hemingway advises to stop writing when you feel like you’ve reached the high point of an idea. Joan Didion would put her manuscript in the freezer, when she felt stuck.
The more that I pursue creative endeavors, the more I realize that life is not about the end goal, but rather the journey; and the journey consists of chunks: bite-sized pieces of information, knowledge, and insights, that accrue over a long time.</description>

      <title>Making the Case to Be a Generalist</title>

      <description>Generalists vs. Specialists School teaches us to think like specialists. You are probably already familiar with the specialist mental model for problem solving:
  make a list of all anticipated tasks
  complete the first task
  complete the second task
  continue to complete all tasks until there are none left
  The specialist approach makes it seem as if problem solving is linear, as if completing one task will unlock another task, and just like a game, you keep leveling up until you’ve won.</description>

      <description>Scott Barry Kaufman is a good man. He’s a cognitive scientist who studies human potential and has taught at Columbia, NYU, and UPenn. He’s also a ginormous optimist so studying the work of fellow humanistic psychologist, Abraham Maslow, was the perfect project for Scott.
Scott never met Maslow in person, yet somehow he developed a strong affinity for him. Scott writes in his book, Transcend: The New Science of Self Actualization:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I saw that the personality of man is like layer upon layer of glass. The specific vision was of irregular but cleanly geometric pieces, each behind the other onto infinity. Each piece of glass was attached on pivots at the top and bottom. At any place, if any piece were turned slightly it would reflect an external picture and, like a mirror, block any further vision inside.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had insomnia, and at midnight, I dizzily got out of bed and walked to my office, opened my computer, and typed the following:
 &amp;ldquo;There is a voice in my head telling me to write, and like a blind man I feel my way through each word, each letter, it feels right.:&amp;rdquo;
 In the original version, in my sleepy stupor, I misspelled two words: blind and word.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig, and I was blown away. The book was published in 1974 and The London Telegraph and BBC have described it as, “the most widely read philosophy book, ever.”
Upon reflection on the book’s wild success, Pirsig said:
 &amp;ldquo;In the early seventies when it was being written, I had those dreams, of course, but didn’t let myself dwell on them or express them publicly for fear they would be interpreted as megalomania and a regression to my former mental illness.</description>

      <title>Structuring a social network</title>

      <description>Social relationships can be complex systems, reaching their full potential when they are designed like a collection of elements that, in sum, are greater than their parts.
It’s helpful to think of social relationships like a redundant decentralized network, without a central hub. Instead of one, or a few individuals, at the center, acting like the central node through which information must flow, communication overlaps and can result in transformational output.</description>

      <description>After writing 15 newsletters and a short story, my writing is still a shit-hill.
As George Saunders explains in his book, “A Swim in the Pond in the Rain,” all writers are faced with a “shit-hill,” representing their bad writing. The first step to becoming a better writer is to accept that you have a shit-hill and then committing to working diligently on it, until, one day, your writing will stop being a shit-hill.</description>
